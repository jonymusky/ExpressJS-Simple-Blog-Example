# ExpressJS-Simple-Blog-Example

Endpoints:
-	GET 			/posts
- 	GET 			/posts/new (last post)
- 	GET 			/posts/:id (specific article)
- 	POST 			/posts/:id (add new post)
- 	DELETE			/posts/:id (delete specific post)


This project is just an example to ilustrate the basic workaround of ExpressJS.
This project dosn't use a database to store the posts so if you restart the App you lose the posts.
